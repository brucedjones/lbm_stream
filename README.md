LBM_Stream
==========

This a sample implementation of Origin Streaming for the Lattice Boltzmann Method.

Using preprocessor directives, the code may be compiled using either origin streaming or the traditional two-lattice approach to streaming.

The code was written with Visual Studio 2010, however it should compile with GCC.
